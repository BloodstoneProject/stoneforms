## 💼 **LINKEDIN POST**

```
🎉 Excited to share what I've been building: Stoneforms!

After seeing companies pay $1,000+/month for multiple tools (Typeform, HubSpot, Calendly, Mailchimp), I built an all-in-one platform that does it better.

🚀 What makes Stoneforms different:

1. AI Form Generation
Describe what you need in plain English, get a professional form instantly. No other platform has this.

2. Built-in CRM
Forms automatically create contacts. Track deals through a visual pipeline. No data exports needed.

3. Visual Workflow Automation
Build complex automations with drag-and-drop. No code required.

4. Appointment Booking
Integrate calendars directly in forms. Like having Calendly built-in.

5. White Label Ready
Custom domain, your branding, your business.

💰 Pricing that makes sense:
Instead of $1,000+/month for multiple tools, Stoneforms starts at $29/month.

🎯 Built for:
• Small businesses needing forms + CRM
• Agencies wanting white-label solutions
• Sales teams automating workflows
• Event planners booking appointments

📊 The Stats:
• 35+ features
• 12+ integrations
• 100% no-code
• Production-ready

### First Comment (Post After Launch):
```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm thrilled to share Stoneforms with you today!

I built this after noticing companies (including my own) were paying $1,000+/month for Typeform + HubSpot + Calendly + Mailchimp. I thought: "Why can't this all be in one place?"

🎯 What I'm Most Proud Of:

1. **AI Form Generation** - This was a game-changer. Just describe what you need, and AI creates the perfect form. No other platform has this.

2. **Visual Workflow Builder** - Built complex automations with zero code. It just works.

3. **Speed** - Built the entire platform in 18 hours. Modern tools make this possible!

💡 What's Next:
Based on your feedback today, I'll prioritize:
• More integrations
• Advanced conditional logic
• Team collaboration features
• Mobile app

```
Hey [Name],

I just launched something I think you'll find interesting.

It's called Stoneforms - a form builder with AI, CRM, and automation built-in.

Why am I telling you?

Because I know you [use forms / run marketing / work with clients], and this could save you hours per week + thousands per month.

🎯 What it does:

1. AI creates forms for you (just describe what you need)
2. Submissions automatically become contacts in the CRM
3. Workflows automate follow-ups
4. Customers can book appointments right in forms

All in one place. No exports, no integrations, no headaches.

💰 Instead of paying:
• $99/mo for Typeform
• $800/mo for HubSpot
• $300/mo for Mailchimp
• $16/mo for Calendly

= $1,215/month

You pay $79/month for everything.
