## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **React Server Components** where appropriate
- **Client Components** for interactivity
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** for backend
- **Drizzle ORM** for database
- **PostgreSQL** (Supabase)

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Zustand over Redux** - Simpler, less boilerplate
2. **Drizzle over Prisma** - Better TypeScript support, faster
3. **Server Actions** - For form submissions (later)
4. **Monorepo** - Everything in one place, easier to develop

2. **Test as you go** - Don't build too much without testing
3. **Use the builder** - Actually try creating forms to find UX issues
4. **Keep it simple** - MVP first, polish later
5. **Document decisions** - Update this file as you progress
